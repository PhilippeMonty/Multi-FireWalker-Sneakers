# Multi-FireWalker-Sneakers
Updated Adafruit FireWalker sneaker code to support multiple display palettes on the Adafruit Gemma M0

Uses the flash memory in the Gemma M0 to cycle between different color palettes
Each time you power on an off a different pattern is selected.

Uses the ISR technique with a vibration sensor as per the Adafruit Gemma firewalker sneaker project
